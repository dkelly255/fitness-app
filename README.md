Business Model
Purpose of business, any marketing strategies - using facebook

# SECTION 1: UX

I have designed the site using the five planes of UX approach, each of which is reviewed in detail in the following sections

## 1. Strategy
The ecommerce strategy for the site is to offer a business-to-customer (B2C) resource to users interested in Fitness where they can purchase Clothing and Nutrition, and can have the ability to participate in a community discussing their own topics, comments, and replies and to engage within a broader community of members and customers.

As part of the E-Commerce strategy a facebook business page for the site has been designed and developed per below to aid with increasing the business' brand reach and to suuport with both developing new customers and retaining existing customers:

The strategic aim of the site is to deliver the following **Epics**:

1. Epic 1 - Create an Ecommerce Website App to allow users to purchase fitness apparrell and nutritional products
2. Epic 2 - Create a community within the website to enhance the business brand and encourage members to purchase more products from the store

With these two broad epics as the overall strategic goal of the project, we are then able to refine the epics into the following **User Stories**, each of which must have a clearly defined set of **Acceptance Criteria**:

## Scope

To deliver the scope of the project, an Agile approach to Software Development has been pursued for the project implementation. There are many useful resources available giving context and perspectives on the advantages of an Agile Software Development practice - including the Agilemanifesto.org and Agilealliance.org which are good starting points, and summarise Agile Software Development as "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools, Working software over comprehensive documentation, Customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and Responding to change over following a plan"

There are many principles and features common to Agile approaches, including, Scrums, Sprints, and Kanban boards - I am currently managing the project scope via multiple kanban boards using Github's built-in Kanban board functionality, with a board for managing the delivery of user stories, and a board for managing the bugs & debugging exercises through the development lifecycle. And work through daily sprints in taking each of the tasks through their stages of completion:

A view of the Kanban board with the user stories having been brought through "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" columns as follows:
