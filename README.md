# Fitness App

 FitnessApp is a [Heroku deployed](https://fitness-app-p5.herokuapp.com/) Full-Stack E-commerce Application with authentication mechanisms & paid access to the site's merchandise. 

![Title](readme/amiresponsive.png)

# SECTION 1: UX

I have designed the site using the five planes of UX approach, each of which is reviewed in detail in the following sections

## 1. Strategy

- E-Commerce Strategy & Business Model:

The Ecommerce strategy for the site is to offer a business-to-customer (B2C) resource - also called Retail Ecommerce - to users interested in Fitness where they can purchase Clothing and Nutritional products that will suit their hobbies and lifestyle. 

The B2C/Retail Ecommerce strategy will be advantageous to the company over a traditional store-based retail approach in this case as it should allow Fitness-App to reach more customers, reduce their overhead costs, and create detailed customer profiles. 

As part of the E-commerce strategy, Site Users & Customers will also the ability to participate in a community discussing their own topics, comments, and replies and to engage within a broader community of members and customers - this community aspect should provide another effective platform from which the company can find new customers and work on retinaing existing customers.

- Marketing Strategy:

As part of the primary marketing strategy, a facebook business page for the site has been designed and developed per below to aid with increasing the business' brand reach and to support with both developing new customers and retaining existing customers. Facebook are currently deleting many business pages so the screenshot below is attached as a record in case of deletion.


![Mockup](readme/mockup.png)

## Scope

The Scope of the site is broadly encompassed in the delivery of the following **Epics**:

1. Epic 1 - Create an Ecommerce Website App to allow users to purchase fitness apparrell and nutritional products
2. Epic 2 - Create a community within the website to enhance the business brand and encourage members to purchase more products from the store

With these two broad epics as the overall strategic goal of the project, we are then able to refine the epics into the following **User Stories**, each of which must have a clearly defined set of **Acceptance Criteria**

To deliver the scope of the project, an Agile approach to Software Development has been pursued for the project implementation. There are many useful resources available giving context and perspectives on the advantages of an Agile Software Development practice - including the Agilemanifesto.org and Agilealliance.org which are good starting points, and summarise Agile Software Development as "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools, Working software over comprehensive documentation, Customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and Responding to change over following a plan"

There are many principles and features common to Agile approaches, including, Scrums, Sprints, and Kanban boards - I am currently managing the project scope via multiple kanban boards using Github's built-in Kanban board functionality, with a board for managing the delivery of user stories, and a board for managing the bugs & debugging exercises through the development lifecycle. And work through daily sprints in taking each of the tasks through their stages of completion.

A view of the Kanban board with the user stories having been brought through "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" columns as follows:

### Tasks

## Structure

The website is structured using the Django Framework functionality, pages for an overview of the site (About Us), Merchandise, the Community section and the Support section. The home page greets the visitor with a welcome message and links to the main Merchandise content of the site via the `Browse Now` button, the Merchandise page houses products currently available to purchase from the site.

The core website data will be stored in a PostgreSQL Database, and website static files and media/images will be stored on the Amazon AWS Platform, with the app being deployed via Heroku. 

## Code Structure

### - *Model, View, Template*

Generically the project is structured using the "Model, View, Template" software design pattern. 

- The Model supports with database management, being a data access layer which primarily handles data. 
- The Views are used to execute the business logic and interact with the model to carry data and render a template
- The Templates are the presentation layers, which handle the User Interface aspects of the application.

The diagram below (sourced from [Towards-Data-Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/working-structure-of-django-mtv-architecture-a741c8c64082)) illustrates the MVT structure & control flow used for this project:

![MVT](readme/mvt.png)

### - *Requirements.txt* 

The project structure includes a requirements.txt in keeping with Python Standards & best practices - as per this overview from [idkrtm.com](https://www.idkrtm.com/what-is-the-python-requirements-txt/), the requirements.txt file is used for specifying which Python packages are required to run the overall project.

The current packages and dependencies list for the project are shown below:

![Requirements](readme/requirements.png)

### - *Procfile*

A Procfile is also an integral element of the project structure - as per the overview in [medium.com](https://medium.com/@bennettgarner/deploying-django-to-heroku-procfile-static-root-other-pitfalls-e7ab8b2ba33b) - the Procfile is a file in the project's root directory that tells Heroku how the application should start and run - in this case, via a Gunicorn server.


## Database Structure & Schema

The Database schema is mapped below - the application will contain eleven Models across six Apps - The diagram illustrates each App, Model, and field, with the relationships between each entity also shown where certain models have Foreign Keys to other models.

![Requirements](readme/erd.png)

### - Production Database - PostgreSQL:

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is the database system used for the models in production - As illustrated in this overview at [postgresqltutorial.com](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/what-is-postgresql/) - PostgreSQL is an advanced, enterprise-class, open-source relational database system, which supports both relational querying, and is compatible with most popular programming languages (including Python) and is therefore ideal for the requirements of this project.

### - Development Database - SQLite3:

[SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is the database system used for the models in testing and development - As illustrated in this overview at [Python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) - SQLite3 a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language, and is typically used in Django Applications for testing & development.

### - Crispy Forms

The project structure also utilises an application known as [CrispyForms](https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to enable controlling the rendering behaviour of the key forms within the application.

As per this overview article at [merixstudio.com](https://www.merixstudio.com/blog/django-crispy-forms-what-are-they-about/) Django-crispy-forms is an application that helps to manage Django forms and allows adjusting forms' properties (such as method, send button or CSS classes) on the backend without having to re-write them in the template.

## 4. Skeleton

The wireframes below illustrate the skeleton of the site, including the home page, login page, signup page, together with the various nav bars and footers that underpin the site structure:

- Wireframe 1 - Home Page

![Home page](readme/wireframe-home.png)

- Wireframe 2 - Merchandise

![Products page](readme/wireframe-merchandise.png)

- Wireframe 3 - Discussion Forum

![Forum](readme/wireframe-forum.png)

- Wireframe 4 - Support

![Support](readme/wireframe-support.png)

- Wireframe 5 - Shopping Bag

![Shopping Bag](readme/wireframe-shoppingbag.png)

- Wireframe 6 - Checkout

![Checkout](readme/wireframe-checkout.png)

## 5. Surface

I have used the Bootstrap framework to build the Surface of the website, with the following design choices helping to deliver the optimum user experience:

- Typography

For the Fonts on the site I am primarily using [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato) for site content - As per the overview on Google Fonts [linked](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato), is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in Polish):

![Lato](readme/lato.png)

- Color Palette

As part of the surface layer of the website's user experience, I wanted to use a Blue color palette as part of the site's theme - Bootstrap has a large array of color-schemes & themes to choose from, illustrated in the screenshot below:

![color](readme/bootsrap_color.png)

A deeper dive on the Blue color scheme allows many different shades, hues, and opacities depending on the user's needs, for the majority of the site's surface I am using the default shade of Blue (code #0d6efd & its' derivations) - shown below:

![blue](readme/bootstrap_color_blue.png)

- Imagery

I am using Fitness-related imagery throughout the Surface layer of the site, to help with promoting a positive User Experience for the target audience. The imagery is primarily consisted of different exercise-related pictures & illustrations. The site's background image is also selected due to it's relevance to fitness/exercise, and having a similar color palette that matches with the site's surface. The background image was sourced from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/) and is fully acknowledged in the credits section of this readme document. Some examples of the site imagery are shown below:

![Imagery](readme/imagery.png)

- Iconography

I have utilised the functionality available through the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) suite to embed the site's icons, this helps emphasise important elements of the site, and to help with generating a positive emotional response with the site users. 

![alt text](readme/iconography.png)


Additionally I have added a favicon, which displays at the top of all the site's pages in the browser tabs via the head element of the HTML to help with the User Experience & create a professional feel when browsing:

## 1. Authorisation, Authentication & Permission Features:

Throughout the site I have identified and applied various layers of authorisation, authentication and permission features in keeping with a full-stack web application solution. Some examples to highlight these features are illustrated below:

### - Signup Form:

To ensure that the proper role-based registration functionality is in place, I have used a Signup form as illustrated below - where in order to create an account, Users should navigate to the "Signup" link in the nav bar, redirecting them to the "Signup" page shown below. The form is built using Django Allauth, and consists of an invitation & instruction set to the user to direct them on how to create an account with the site, there are five fields the user can fill in to supply the required details for creation of a new account - Username, Email, Password, and a confirmation of the password. 

![Signup](readme/features-signup.png)

The current login status is also consistently reflected to the user, via prompts on the signup form reminding the user that they should "Sign In" rather than "Sign Up" if they already have an account, also ensuring that the user is not permitted to access restricted content or functionality prior to role-based login, and the provision of all information will ensure the correct permissions are then reflected to the user.

### - Signup Email Confirmation:

A confirmation email will be sent to each user who requests an account with site - the email will request the user to confirm their account by clicking on a link included in the email. This contributes to keeping the site user-base secure and help safeguard the site from any potential malicious or opportunistic behaviour:

![Signup](readme/features-signupmail.png)

### - Login Form

To apply role-based login functionality, the Login form is built using Django Allauth, and gives two fields for completion to grant the user access to the appropriate *user-level* (i.e. non-administrator) site features such as saving their default delivery information for quick purchases, leaving comments or creating topics or replies. 

From a UX perspective, the current login state is reflected to the user via additional notifications delivered to the user on the Login form that they must be logged in to create a topic or leave a comment, and that if they have not yet created an account that they must Sign Up first to ensure that the correct role-based functionality is understood and applied. This also again helps to ensure that users are not permitted to access restricted content and/or functionality prior to their role-based login.

![Login](readme/features-login.png)

### - Logout Form

The Logout form screenshot is shown below, illustrating the simple & intuitive nature of this feature, whereby the user is prompted with a confirmation that they wish to log out of the site, and a button they can click to confirm they wish to do so. A defensive design principle has been used for this form, so that a user cannot log out mistakenly with a single click, the confirmation button will help provide a positive UX where the user is less likely to log out accidentally, and also reinforcing the principle that the current login state is reflected to the user.

## 2. Ecommerce Features:

The primary focus of the site is on offering e-commerce functionality to users in the form of two types of products available for purchase - Nutrition and Apparell. The section below covers an overview of the main e-commerce features of the site: 

### - Display Products

The "Product display" page is the central e-commerce hub of the site, and contains a listing of all of the currently listed products available for sale on the site, together with options for sorting by price, category, name and rating. The page will also display a count of the displayed products, and will have a search bar at the top of the page consistent with the rest of the site.

![Features](readme/features-displayproducts.png)

### - Product Detail

The product detail page is reached by clicking on the image of any of the displayed products. This will bring the user to a more detailed overview of the selected product, including an in-depth description of the product, together with the product's price and rating. A size selector will also be present for any Apparrell products with sizes, and a quantity selector will allow the user to specify their desited quantity.

## Unresolved Bugs

There are no known unresolved bugs in this release of the application

# Deployment

The application is deployed via Heroku, and a link to the live deployment can be found by clicking [here](https://fitness-app-p5.herokuapp.com/)

An extended list of detailed steps & instructions for deployment is covered in the section below:

## Github Deployment

Note - please ensure you have created a GitHub repository prior to proceeding to the "Heroku" deployment section below to ensure no rework or deployment issues

## Amazon AWS Deployment

Firstly - Navigate to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and create a new account, choosing your username, password, verification method and email address details. Then click on the `S3 Storage` option to open the Amazon AWS S3 Storage application:

![AWS5](readme/deployment/aws-5.png)

The Steps for deployment to Amazon AWS are as follows - Please note these steps are correct and current as at the time of application release (June 2022) but may be subject to change in future:

### - Create bucket:

When creating a bucket there are several configuration options. Most of
these can be left default but the Object Ownership setting (below) needs to be set as shown with the
ACLs enabled option checked.

![AWS1](readme/deployment/aws-1.png)

### - Bucket settings:

The S3 Bucket options page is a scrollable page broken into sections:

- On the properties tab, static website hosting can now be found by scrolling down to the bottom.
- On the permissions tab, the three settings covered in the video have their own section.
- AWS has changed the format of their CORS configuration - the updated code is shown below. Paste
that into the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) section.

![AWS2](readme/deployment/aws-2.png)

The Bucket Policy is unchanged.

For the Access control list (ACL) section, click edit and enable List for Everyone (public access) and
accept the warning box. If the edit button is disabled you need to change the Object Ownership
section above to ACLs enabled (refer to Create Bucket section above).

![AWS3](readme/deployment/aws-3.png)

### - Identify and Access Management (IAM)

- Create group:

The sidebar name is now User Groups and everything happens on a single page instead of clicking
next as shown in the videos.

- Create policy:

On the create policy page there is now a button to go to the next page to add tags. Tags are optional,
but you must click it to get to the review policy page.

- Attach policy:

To attach the policy, on the sidebar click User Groups. Select your group, go to the permissions tab,
open the Add permissions dropdown, and click Attach policies. Select the policy and click Add
permissions at the bottom.

![AWS4](readme/deployment/aws-4.png)

## Heroku Deployment

The Steps for deployment to Heroku are as follows - Please note these steps are correct and current as at the time of application release (June 2022) but may be subject to change in future:
